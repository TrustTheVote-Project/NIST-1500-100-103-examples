The Jetsons live in Orbit City, in Gadget County.

The Gadget County Elections Board runs elections for the electoral district that is the county itself (including statewide and state level elections), as well as the two jurisdictions within the county: Orbit City with its offices for City Council and for Mayor; and the Spaceport District, with its offices for the Spaceport Control Board that regulates the use of the SpacePort and who supervise staff actitvity to collect landing fees and use funds for spaceport upkeep.

There are 4 precincts in the County: the Downtown Precinct is the part of the county that’s in Orbit City but not in the SpacePort District; the Spacetown Precinct is the part of the county that’s both in Orbit City and the SpacePort District; the Port Precinct is the part of the county that’s in the SpacePort District but not in Orbit City; the Bedrock Precinct is the part of the county that’s in neither Orbit City nor the SpacePort District (named for a predecessor town that archaeologists found traces of in the remote part of the county).

All residents of the county can vote in elections for any seat on the Gadget County Board of Supervisors, and also any county-level ballot question. That’s all that Residents of the Bedrock Precinct can only vote for. In addition to county voting, residents of the Downtown and Spacetown Precincts can vote for Orbit City Council and Orbit City Mayor, and any city-level ballot question. In addition to county voting, residents of the Spacetown Precinct and Port Precinct can for vote for the Spaceport Control Board.

An upcoming special election has been called because the mayor, the venerable Montague Jetson, recently announced early retirement. Two candidates are running for the seat: Cosmo Spacely and Spencer Cogswell. Since each had to resign his seat on Spaceport Control Board in order to run for Mayor, there are two open seats on the Board, and 3 candidates running: Jane Jetson, Harlan Ellis, Rudi Indexer. In addition, the Gadget County Board of Supervisors have placed a ballot question on raising the county sales tax.

The ballots in the upcoming election, therefore, are:

Bedrock Precinct: county ballot question 1

Port Precinct: Spaceport Control Board, county ballot question 1

Spacetown Precinct: Orbit City Mayor, Spaceport Control Board, county ballot question 1

Downtown Precinct: Orbit City Mayor, county ballot question 1

Orbit City elections are partisan contests, with Spacely in the Lepton Party, and Cogswell in the Hadron Party. Both of them are listed on the ballot with the party affiliation. Spaceport Control Board elections are non partisan, and candidates are listed by profession rather than party: Jane as Independent Consultant, Harlan as Author, and Rudi as Sentient Search Engine. Both contests include a write-in option. The text of the ballot question is “Shall Gadget County increase its sales tax from 1% to 1.1% for the purpose of raising additional revenue to fund expanded air traffic control operations?” and the answers are “Yes” and “No”.
